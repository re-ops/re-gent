# Intro

Re-gent is a ZeroMQ based agent that enables the execution of distributed Clojure functions on a cluster of machines.

It is used in [Re-mote](https://re-ops.github.io/re-docs/setup/re-mote.html#re-mote) [pipelines](https://re-ops.github.io/re-docs/#abstractions) to execute remote serializable Clojure functions.

Follow the official [docs](https://re-ops.github.io/re-docs/setup/re-gent.html) for more information on how to [build](https://re-ops.github.io/re-docs/setup/re-gent.html#build) and [deploy](https://re-ops.github.io/re-docs/setup/re-gent.html#deploy) it to remote machines managed by [Re-core](https://github.com/re-ops/re-core).
